##### Overview

A simple program written in C# designed to manage and sort the entire Hymmnos lexicon from the Ar Tonelico series.

Features:
 - Includes a UTF-16-encored .txt file that contains the entire Hymmnos lexicon
 - Displays characteristics of the Hymmnos language, such as the number of records in each Hymmnos dialect
 - Sorts the lexicon alphabetically based on the word, meaning, class, kana, or dialect
 - Allows the user to search for specific word parameters such as:
     - Nouns
     - Verbs
     - Adjectives
     - Prepositions
     - Conjunctions
     - Adverbs
     - Pronouns
     - Constructs
     - Particles
     - Interjections
     - Emotion-Verbs
     - Emotion-Sounds
 - Allows the user to search for specific words or meanings.
 - Includes a toggle to remove New Testament of Pastalie words from the search results; as Pastalie is a dialect unique to the Infel Phira SH server, it cannot be used with other Hymmnos words.
